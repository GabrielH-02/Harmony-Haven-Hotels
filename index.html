                    <p>
                        Welcome to Harmony Haven Hotels! Our names are Alison and George and we spent the years of 2000 to 2004 traveling the
            globe full-time. Through our journeys, from bustling Asian markets to serene European landscapes, we understood the
            magnifying power of travel. Fuelled by our many adventures we embarked in creating Harmony Haven Hotels. Through our
            travels we have stayed in some of the most amazing hotels in the world as well as our fair share of bad ones too. A main
            contributing factor which made these decisions so difficult was price.
            <br><br>
            Therefore Harmony Haven Hotels is a hotel membership program, allowing young travellers to feel welcomed, and safe whilst
            making their own adventures. Spanning over 6 continents and 36 different hotels across the world, Harmony Haven Hotels
            has provided <a href="#section3">countless travellers</a> with good quality stays and at constant price. With our two <a href="#section2">offers</a> available you can
            explore and make your own special memories.

                        Such a great program. Helped me so much with traveling, I didn't have to think about the chaotic booking process. The
                    team was so helpful and even adjusted my payment period to be flexible with my needs.

                    <p>
                        Highly recommend this program. So easy to use and avoid any confusion with booking especially in foreign countries.
                    Rooms were amazing and breakfast was so good and culturally diverse.

                    <h4>Sophia, 27</h4>

                    <p>
                        Needed this for a well. Best experience I've had with such a program. Wanted to travel the world for so long but prices
                        always held me back. But once they spoke to the team they managed to work out a payment plan to fit my schedule.

                    <p>
                        If you want to travel in style this program is for you, such great rooms, amazing staff and the best of help from the
                        team. Even helped me plan for traveling around the city I was staying in.

                    <h4>Isabella, 26</h4>

                    <p>
                        I went with three of my friends on this program, and we don't know what we would have done without it. As three young
                    women traveling alone we were a bit concerned with our safety, but once we entered every hotel we felt safe and secure.

                    <h4>Noah, 20</h4>

                    <p>
                        Simply amazing, just a great program. Don't think I would have had the same memories I did, without this program. Can't
                    believe I was able to experience a trip that didn't involve any drama. I was so lucky to stay in every single hotel.
