# Harmony Haven Hotels

Harmony Haven Hotels is a site that wishes to promote the use of the hotel’s programs. Harmony Haven Hotels is a hotel chain that has multiple hotels across six continents, and a major problem for young travellers when travelling the world is the constant change in quality and price in hotels. Therefore Harmony Haven Hotels have two major programs to choose from that allow users to pay a monthly fee to stay at any Harmony Haven Hotel across the world. Thus through the use of the site Harmony Haven Hotels can promote their programmes. The goal of the site is to promote and increase the number of members.

The site will be targeted to young travellers wishing to stay at safe and luxurious hotels at a constant price and quality. The user will be able to find out all the information they need about the programmes and how to become a member of Harmony Haven Hotels. This is done by the use of the three major interactive pages of Harmony Haven Hotels website. The site contains a ‘Home’ page, a ‘Destinations’ page and a ’Sign-up’ page accompanied by a landing page once the data for the sign-up page has been submitted. The home page contains information about Harmony Haven Hotels and its origins, the deals and offers the site provides and a section of comments reviewing the service from fellow young travellers. The site uses interactive and stylistic choices to encourage the user to achieve their own goals as well as the site's owner. Harmony Haven Hotels will be useful for travellers to see and join a service that can help them on their travels.

__The Header__

* Featured on all three major pages of the site, it is fully responsive to all devices and includes a central navigation bar. It includes four links, Logo, Home page, Destinations page, and Sign up page. 
  - This keeps an organized, simple and consistent look for the website making it easy for the user to navigate through the page on all devices.

* The title/logo of the site is on the left and links to the home page. Through it links to the home page there is also another link to the right which is for the home page too. The other two are for the destinations page and the signup page
  - This continues to be consistent for the user and makes it easy and simple to use.

* When viewed on a laptop or desktop or any device that uses a mouse to navigate through the page when hovered on the link the color will change to brighter. When the linked page is being viewed, the link will appear underlined and coloured. The Sign Up linked text appears to be coloured on tablets and larger devices.
  - This allows the user to see the current page in use, whilst also showing the user that the other links are interactive, therefore encouraging the user to explore the site more.

* On tablets and larger devices, the header will appear with all four linked text on the header but on smaller devices, the header will be seen as the title/logo to the left and icon toggle which will appear as a dropdown button.
  - This continues to be organized but also adapting to the change in device size. Thus adapting to the user's needs.

* The one exception to the header is on the landing page once the data of the sign-up page has been submitted, contains one link to the home page with an arrow icon to the left and the text ‘Home’.
  - This allows the user to simply note that on this page there is nothing to interact with, therefore returning the user to the home page to learn more.
