# Harmony Haven Hotels

Harmony Haven Hotels is a site that wishes to promote the use of the hotel’s programs. Harmony Haven Hotels is a hotel chain that has multiple hotels across six continents, and a major problem for young travellers when travelling the world is the constant change in quality and price in hotels. Therefore Harmony Haven Hotels have two major programs to choose from that allow users to pay a monthly fee to stay at any Harmony Haven Hotel across the world. Thus through the use of the site Harmony Haven Hotels can promote their programmes. The goal of the site is to promote and increase the number of members.

The site will be targeted to young travellers wishing to stay at safe and luxurious hotels at a constant price and quality. The user will be able to find out all the information they need about the programmes and how to become a member of Harmony Haven Hotels. This is done by the use of the three major interactive pages of Harmony Haven Hotels website. The site contains a ‘Home’ page, a ‘Destinations’ page and a ’Sign-up’ page accompanied by a landing page once the data for the sign-up page has been submitted. The home page contains information about Harmony Haven Hotels and its origins, the deals and offers the site provides and a section of comments reviewing the service from fellow young travellers. The site uses interactive and stylistic choices to encourage the user to achieve their own goals as well as the site's owner. Harmony Haven Hotels will be useful for travellers to see and join a service that can help them on their travels.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### General Features

__The Header__

* Featured on all three major pages of the site, it is fully responsive to all devices and includes a central navigation bar. It includes four links, Logo, Home page, Destinations page, and Sign up page. 
  - This keeps an organized, simple and consistent look for the website making it easy for the user to navigate through the page on all devices.

* The title/logo of the site is on the left and links to the home page. Through it links to the home page there is also another link to the right which is for the home page too. The other two are for the destinations page and the signup page
  - This continues to be consistent for the user and makes it easy and simple to use.

* When viewed on a laptop or desktop or any device that uses a mouse to navigate through the page when hovered on the link the color will change to brighter. When the linked page is being viewed, the link will appear underlined and coloured. The Sign Up linked text appears to be coloured on tablets and larger devices.
  - This allows the user to see the current page in use, whilst also showing the user that the other links are interactive, therefore encouraging the user to explore the site more.

![header-big](documentation/header-big.png)

* On tablets and larger devices, the header will appear with all four linked text on the header but on smaller devices, the header will be seen as the title/logo to the left and icon toggle which will appear as a dropdown button.
  - This continues to be organized but also adapting to the change in device size. Thus adapting to the user's needs.

![header-small](documentation/header-small.png)

* The one exception to the header is on the landing page once the data of the sign-up page has been submitted, contains one link to the home page with an arrow icon to the left and the text ‘Home’.
  - This allows the user to simply note that on this page there is nothing to interact with, therefore returning the user to the home page to learn more.

![header-signup](documentation/header-signup.png)

__The Footer__

* On all pages of the site, the footer is present keeping the same view for all pages. The footer contains two major aspects; contact information- with an email address and a phone number. As well as icons that link and open in a new tab to four different social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and Instagram.
  - This allows the user to explore and learn more about the server through social networks which is a comfortable portal for the chosen user audience, being young travelers as well as keeping a basic contact information section too.

* Like the links found in the header, links to the email address and phone number are constantly left highlighted. Also when the user uses a device that is directed by a mouse the text hovered over the text will grow lighter. On top of all this when the links for contact information are used the links then direct the user to the appropriate way to contact the company, for example, When the user clicks on the link to the email address this then opens the mail application and fills the ‘to’ input with the companies email address, and the same goes for the phone number it will automatically open the default application for calling.
  - This allows the user to have an interactive experience within the site and provides a clear indication that features can be interactive. The links also provide the user with a productive way of contacting the company.

![footer-big](documentation/footer-big.png)

* Each aspect is correctly labelled to continue to provide a clear outline of the footer, however, the label for the social networks disappears once the screen size drops past a standard tablet device and the aspects then are stated into a column rather than a row. While also creating horizontal lines to divide the text more.
  - This aspect adapts to the user's needs to any device they use, as well as provides the user with a simplistic way of contacting and interacting with the company. As well as dividing the information separately.

![footer-small](documentation/footer-small.png)

__The Cover Images/messages and Nav Bars__

* The two main information pages (home page and destinations page), start with a cover image with a cover text message and directly below it is a navigation bar that directs links to sections found on that specific page.
  - This keeps a consistent and welcoming look to the initial view of the page.

* On both pages there is an image that is tailored to that specific page, for example on the destinations page the image is a bird eye view of someone working out a plan with a map. On top of that cover image is a message that adapts to the size of the image below it. It has a semi-transparent background colour, the text itself is cursive and contains a motivational quote such as “Choose Your Own Path!”. These features are most responsive to any size and move simultaneously.
  - This provides the user with a welcoming and motivational reaction when they first arrive on the page, therefore prompting them to become a member. Whilst also keeping a consistent look and feel for every page. This also provides the user with access to the site on any device. It covers the entire width of the page sets somewhat of a divide and blocks off and spaces out features of the page, therefore providing a simplistic look to the site.

![cover-image-home](documentation/cover-image-home.png)
![cover-image-destinations](documentation/cover-image-destinations.png)

* Below both welcome images is a responsive navigation bar that directs the user to certain aspects of the page. Each is linked and when interacted with the page will smoothly scroll down to the linked section. These elements are specific for each of the pages and have the same hover feature as other linked text.
  - This continues to provide the user with an interactive and organized way of navigating through the page and also keeps a constant flow.

__The Style__

* The style of the site is kept consistent and clear. Throughout the site, it keeps the same fonts, colours, shapes, and layout.
  - The fonts of the site are all imported from Google Fonts and are kept to a minimum of three fonts. ‘Kadwa’ is for the major headings, ‘Bitter’ is for the body text and ‘Dancing-script’ is used for motivational quotes of the cover images for example. This allows the viewer to correctly identify the structure of the site. As well as keep a variation in the display.  
  - The colours of the site are kept to a minimum of three the major colours are #f1f1f1 (an off-white colour), #3a3a3a (an off-black colour), and #81a59b (a neutral duck-egg blue). The feature colour is duck-egg blue, it is the primary colour of the site and acts as a feature colour. Any other colour is a variety of duck-egg colours. This keeps a simplistic colour scheme that resembles calm natural tones that match the feeling of calm and peaceful holidays. Therefore this helps the user to experience a calming site with neutral colors, therefore prompting the user to become a member of a calm and peaceful holiday service.
  - As a whole the site integrates square and circular aspects to feature. However, the site creates a modern and structured shape. For example, the images on a page are circular since this helps to break up the space around the image but makes it more inviting to look at for the user. Using circular elements within the site continues to provide the user with a calming effect.
  - The layout of the Home page and Destinations Page are relatively the same, but altered in various sections will colour, This keeps the style and colour consistent while also exploring the possibility of different tones and variations to the page to make them stand out more. This allows the user to experience a site that is consistent while also not being too consistent by making the pages identical to one another.

## Testing

* I have tested the site on multiple browsers, such as; Chrome, Safari and Firebox.
* The site and all of its pages are responsive to all devices and have a clear and organized format. I have tested this by using dev tools on Chrome as well as sharing the link to the site on my other devices. The site also has been tested and its structure also adapts to the screen size.
* All the information on the site is clear and visible as well and the contrast of colour is well set and it is readable and easy to understand. I have also shared the site with other people to have an understanding of other views on the site and all came to the same result that the site is easy to read and understand.
* I have made sure that all links to other sections of the page work, as well as I tested links that open tabs and/or open contact applications all work perfectly. As well as this I have tested the hover function on all linked items on the site and they all work.
* Finally, I have made sure that the form inputs are required and only the appropriate value for the form to be submitted. I have done this by removing the temporary ‘Let’s go’ button with a submit input, and it confirms that the other inputs work perfectly.

### Bugs

#### Fixed Bugs
* Whilst in the process of testing I found some bugs/ errors in code on the site;
* The Deals and Offers link on the specific navigation bar on the homepage was not linking to the section on the page therefore it needed to be adjusted with the proper id value.
* Another error that appeared was the fact that in my final unvalidated version of the site, I used aria-labeled values on the divs with the links to images on the style sheet however this was incorrect therefore I removed these labels
* Whilst testing, errors came up in concern to section values with no heading values, thus adding these headings, however, added a hidden class in the stylesheet so that these headings would be hidden and wouldn't affect the final version.

#### Unfixed Bugs
* There are no unfixed bugs, the only concern is that on the sign-up page, the “Submit” button is a linked text item that appears to be a button that only directs the user to a landing page.

## Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
* From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch, then click “Save”.
* The page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
